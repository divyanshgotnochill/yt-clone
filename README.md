Created my very first project, i.e. YouTube clone, with the help of HTML and CSS. 
This is a simple YouTube clone built using HTML and CSS. The project replicates the basic structure and layout of the popular video-sharing platform, YouTube, focusing on delivering a user-friendly interface. The design includes a homepage with a video carousel, video thumbnail previews, a sidebar for easy navigation, and a clean, responsive layout.

The project showcases a solid understanding of HTML for structure and CSS for styling, along with the ability to create a modern, aesthetically pleasing layout. While it doesn't include any backend functionality or dynamic features, it effectively demonstrates how to create a static web page that mimics the look and feel of YouTube's user interface.

Features:

->Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

->Video thumbnails with placeholder content.

->Sidebar for navigation (home, trending, subscriptions).

->Clean, minimalistic layout similar to the YouTube homepage.
